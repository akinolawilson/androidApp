```
```console
user@user_name:~$ sudo apt install python3-pip
```
#### Step 3: Use pip to install virtualenv
```console
user@user_name:~$ sudo pip3 install virtualenv
```
#### Step 4: Launch your Python 3 virtual environment, here the name of my virtual environment will be _kivy_project_
```console

```
#### Step 5: Activate your new Python 3 environment. There are two ways to do this

```
or
```console
user@user_name:~$ source kivy_project/bin/activate
